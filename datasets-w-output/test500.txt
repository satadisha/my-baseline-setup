@maddow Wonder if the Russian spies ever got borrowed millions to hook  as discussed in Complaint, and if so, how was it used?

 Carter Page was the target of Counter-terrorism probe &amp; investor in Rosneft, the Russia oil giant &amp; Trump advisor.
@seanhannity @FoxNews @adamhousley @oreillyfactor @TuckerCarlson @SaraCarterDC FISA'S are highly classified so this is another illegal leak
Comey/Nunez: But before you vote, we want to make sure you understand that duplicate Hillary emails that exonerate her have been discovered.
@DavidCornDC Wash Post breaking ... FISA warrant was issued for Carter Page by FBI
Watch @FoxNews work to distance Trump from this--Page is a former adviser NOW, but was on staff when FBI sought warrant.
I think these guys that sold out our country to the devil (Russia) should probably get a Darth Vader like body guard for protection.
Carter Page will be the primary witness for the prosecution, if he lives.

The "Washington Post" says the FBI got a warrant to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page over Page's purported Russian ties.
FBI granted a FISA warrant on trumps campaign adviser Carter Page. FBI told us plenty about Hillary's computer but nothing about treason.
@PaxHart @jasoncamp2013 Wow! DOJ granted FISA warrant on Carter Page. Collusion case tightening.
The secret warrant is first evidence that FBI was investigating Russia-Trump team connection during the campaign.

Essentially, Russia infiltrated trump's campaign and either trump was complicit or stupid
So....distract from Prince Kushner's lies on security clearance by bombing Syria &amp; from campaign adviser's FISA by starting a nuclear war?
So now we have two Trump advisers acting as foreign agents (Flynn/Page) and a repeated pattern of shifting denials.
